# Files

**icsd_results.csv**: list of ABC compositions reported in the ICSD (HHs and non-HHs) as generated by _gen_list_icsd.ipynb_. Note: you will not be able to recreate this file since we cannot release the raw .cif files needed to produce this file

**springer_results.csv**: list of ABC compositions reported in Springer Materials (HHs and non-HHs) as generated by _gen_list_springer.ipynb_. Note: You will not be able to recreate this file since we cannot release the raw .cif files needed to produce this file

**ASM_phase_separating.csv**: list of ABC compositions reported to phase separate in the ASM Phase Diagrams database as generated by _gen_list_ASM.ipynb_. Note: You will not be able to recreate this file since we cannot release the raw phase diagram files needed to produce this file

**actual_phase_separating.csv**: list of ABC compositions reported to phase separate from _ASM_phase_separating.csv_ that are also not reported in _combined_results.csv_

**combined_results.csv**: output file from _icsd_springer_combined_analysis.ipynb_

**training_data.csv**: data from _combined_results.csv_ along with calculated DFT stabilities from the OQMD; this data is directly used to train the ML model
